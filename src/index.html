              <h3>Synopsis</h3>
              <p>
                There is no planet in the whole Empire more inhospitable than
                Dune. Everywhere sands as far as the eye can see. A single
                richness: the spice of long life, born of the desert, and which
                the whole universe covets. When Leto Atreides receives Dune in
                fiefdom, he smells the trap. He will need the Fremen warriors
                who, having taken refuge in the depths of the desert, have
                adapted to a very harsh life while preserving their freedom,
                their customs and their faith. They dream of the prophet who
                will proclaim holy war and change the course of history.
                However, the Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit continue
                their millennial program of genetic selection: they want to
                create a man who will bring together all the latent gifts of the
                species. Has the Fremen Messiah already been born in the Empire?

              <h3>Synopsis</h3>
              <p>
                Paul Atreides triumphed over his enemies. In twelve years of
                holy war, his Fremen have conquered the universe and made him
                Emperor Muad'Dib. Almost a God, since he sees the future, he
                knows his ennemies and he knows when and how they will strike.
                They will try to take back the spice that gives foreknowledge
                and perhaps unlock the secret of its power. He can thwart their
                plans, but sees even further: all possible futures lead to
                disaster. Haunted by the vision of his own death, he wonders if
                he only has the choice between several suicides. What if he
                ruined his work by subduing his enemies? Perhaps there is no
                other freedom for the prescient than that of sacrifice...

              <p>
                On Dune, the planet of the sands, ancient prophecies are being
                fulfilled. Ecological transformation is accelerating: water,
                once more expensive than gold, is flowing, and gardens are
                spilling over into the desert. But Dune's newfound prosperity
                threatens its wealth, the Spice of longevity and prescience. The
                tough Fremen, who carried the banner and the word of Muad'Dib to
                the confines of the human universe, are softening. Giant worms
                are rare. And since Paul went to the desert to die there
                according to the old Fremen tradition because he lost his sight,
                his priests have built on his message of peace an authoritarian
                theocracy which rules the entire galaxy. It is then that the
                destinies of the children of Dune are played out. Leto and
                Ghanima, the twins born to Paul and Chani, awakened to
                consciousness in their mother's womb and carry within them the
                hereditary memories of countless generations. They have to
                thwart the plots of the Abomination dreaded by the Sisters of
                the Bene Gesserit if they want to survive, rebuild the human
                universe shaken by Jihad and reign in turn over Dune.

                >“Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward
                aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to
                evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government
                tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the
                ruling class - whether that class be hereditary royalty,

              <h3>Synopsis</h3>
              <p>
                Leto Atreides, the God-Emperor of Dune, is now a sandworm with a
                human face. Almost invulnerable and immortal, he saw a terrible
                threat in the future: the extinction of the human species. To
                ward it off, he mercilessly enforces, in the human universe, his
                order, the Golden Path. The Empire has known thirty-five
                centuries of peace. The Guild and the Bene Gesserit have their
                hands tied: it is Leto who controls the last reserves of the
                essential spice on Dune. The Tleilaxu and the Ixians have not
                been disarmed: the former regularly deliver to the emperor
                trapped replicas of his faithful ghola, Duncan Idaho, the latter
                send him Hwi Noree, the perfect woman, born from a test tube and
                charged to his to seduce and destroy him. Leto, through his
                prescience, sees a future where he will be seduced; he also sees
                that to save humanity from death, he may have to sacrifice
                himself and the woman he loves, and who awakens old memories.
                The God-Emperor of Dune is for a lot of readers the most moving
                book in this unparalleled series.

              <p>
                Several thousand years have passed since the death of Tyrant,
                the God-Emperor of Dune. His disappearance led to a whirlwind of
                violence, the Great Famine, and then the dispersal of humanity
                across the universes. Thus Tyra's grand design continued to be
                realized: the survival of humanity is assured. But the Bene
                Gesserit, the Tleilax, the Guild of Navigators, and the Priests
                of the God-Emperor continue to contend for hegemony and the
                source of foreknowledge and longevity, the spice. Will Dune,
                whose name has become Rakis, remain the target of all ambitions
                while the Bene Tleilax have learned to produce spice without the
                help of worms? This is the riddle that Reverend Mother Taraza
                must solve when she learns that on Rakis a young girl, almost a
                child, seems to be able to command the giant worms and that, all
                around the Empire, the Lost of the Great Scatter return. Looking
                for what? Or chased by whom?

              <h3>Synopsis</h3>
              <p>
                Dune is destroyed and atomized. The raging hordes of the Honored
                Matres swarm across the Empire, slaying everything in their
                path. The planets fall one after another. The Bene Gesserit
                remains the only organized force. What to do? Darwi Odrade, the
                Mother Superior, relies heavily on Miles Teg, the child-ghola,
                descended from a famous warrior, but whose awakening promises to
                be delicate. Moreover, the solution may not lie in force of
                arms. An Honorable Matriarch, Murbella, passed to the Bene
                Gesserit. If she survives the Agony of the Spice, the forces of
                imbalance, finally mixed, could lead to the impossible union.
                Darwi Odrade proposes to negotiate. The Most Honored Matre
                accepts: she expects an unconditional surrender. But the Mother
                Superior has a plan. She knows very well that the undertaking is
                one of the most risky. If she managed to bring peace, she would
                cause unbearable tensions and perhaps a new Scattering.

                your life. The object can be stated this way: Live the best life
                you can. Life is a game whose rules you learn if you leap into
                it and play it to the hilt. Otherwise, you are caught off
                balance, continually surprised by the shifting play. Non-players
                often whine and complain that luck always passes them by. They
                refuse to see that they can create some of their own

                musicians know it. Surfers I watched when I was a child on
                Gammu, they knew it. Some waves throw you but you're prepared
                for that. You climb back up and go at it once more. There's no
